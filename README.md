# Adaptive RL Agent for Atari Breakout 
This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent that plays Atari Breakout while adapting to dynamically changing game conditions. It tackles a modified environment where difficulty shifts unpredictably â€” testing the agent's robustness, adaptability, and learning capacity.

## Required packages
The code will work on versions of python that are below 3.13.

1. Tensorflow
2. gymnasium
3. ale-py
4. opencv-python
